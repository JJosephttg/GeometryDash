# Introduction 
This was my attempt at creating a platforming game like Geometry Dash using WPF/C#

# What I learned
- Learned about timers, and how to independently use them for both the player and the obstacles
- Learned a bit about how simple collision works
- Learned how to make a platforming game from scratch
